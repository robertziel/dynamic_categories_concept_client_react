# Dynamic Categories Concept React Client

Init based on https://www.reactboilerplate.com

Backend repository: https://github.com/robertziel/dynamic_categories_concept_backend

## Set up:

1. **API URL** is set in `.env` as `BACKEND_API_URL`. In my case I set as `localhost:8080`

2. Run using npm
  ```
  npm run setup
  npm start
  ```

## To do:

* Items search should use **Elasticsearch**
* Fix translations, as this is only a proof of concept I omitted some to speed up coding
* Big refactoring :)
* Use more friendly links than ID
* components/Search/Filters must be refactored
